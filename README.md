I want to go on a date tonight with my significant other. I could use OpenTable to reserve a great place to eat. Then I could use Fandango to find a movie, or Tadoo to find an event. Then I could use Yelp to find a cool bar or snazzy coffee shop for a drink. But that's three tools to solve one challenge! What if there was one tool to do it all?!

Your challenge, should you choose to accept it, is to create one site that pulls together the three key date night components:

- Dinner
- Activity
- Drinks

To do this, here are some suggested data and mapping APIs:

- [Foursquare](https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/)
- [Google Maps](https://developers.google.com/maps/web/)
- [Yelp](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3)
- [Fandango / RottenTomatoes](https://developer.fandango.com/)

### Minimum requirements:

1. When user clicks a button, create a suggested set containing one item from these three categories: Dinner, Activity, Drinks
2. Pull dinner / activity / drinks data from relevant APIs
3. Display results description in list
4. Use some form of randomization so that each button click results in a new set of 3 items

### Bonus features

- Display results as points on Map
- Let user set preferences for types of food, activities, drinks
- User Maps API to minimize drive or walk distance between options
- Let user send an email to themselves with results, populate email with details for times / locations / prices / etc
